# Usage

Some setup is required.
Start by installing both the core library and the [Babel](https://babeljs.i) plugin,
currently only using Compiled with [React](https://reactjs.org) is supported.

```bash
npm install @compiled/core --save
```

Compiled uses Babel to transform your code,
so you'll need to either [use it directly via its CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli) or [configure your bundler to use it](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/).

## Babel setup

Next wire up the plugin in your [Babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration).
It's best if the plugin is defined first in the plugins array.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

Now you're ready to write your first compiled component,

If you're looking for advanced configuration go look at the [plugin API documentation](/pkg-core).
