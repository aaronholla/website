# Overrides Pattern

A method of empowering consumers to add that extra bit of behaviour that we don't want to add just yet or take on the maintenance burden is super useful for maintainers.
One such pattern is the _overrides pattern_.

This could look like...

```jsx
<Button
  overrides={{
    render: (ButtonElement, props) => <ButtonElement {...props} />,
    cssFn: (css) => css,
    attributes: {},
  }}
/>
```

But in a compiled world where styles are just that,
**compiled**,
how can we write a `cssFn` that can return `css` at runtime?

Well,
we can't ðŸ˜….
But we can come close with a mix of using _inline styles_,
and enabling specific CSS properties to be overridden.
Think about what your consumers would usually want to modify and things start to form a shape...
There are probably two main areas:

- Presentation
- Spacing

We could give theming a go and have either CSS variables consumers can modify to change how an element looks,
or we could allow a subset of CSS to be passed down to be set as inline styles or props on your compiled css.
Maybe something like...

```jsx
const StyledBox = styled.div`
  margin-left: ï¼„{(props) => props.css.marginLeft};
`;

const Box = ({ children, overrides = { cssFn: (css) => css } }) => {
  const css = overrides.cssFn({
    marginLeft: '1rem',
  });

  return <StyledBox css={css}>{children}</StyledBox>;
};
```

The benefit of this is two fold:

1. We empower consumers by allowing them to still override things as they need.
1. We introduce constraints - consumers can't do _everything_ now - but they can get pretty close.
   This has both runtime and design benefits,
   think of it as **overrides with guardrails**.
