# Testing

Testing is super important and something that was developed with in mind.
There exists a `jest` matcher to help!
First install the dependency.

```bash
npm i @compiled/jest-css-in-js
```

Then configure it.

```jsx
// test/setup.tsx
import { toHaveCompiledCss } from '@compiled/jest-css-in-js';

expect.extend({
  toHaveCompiledCss,
});
```

```jsx
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./test/setup.tsx'],
};
```

And then reap your rewards!
Here we are using [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) which we highly recommend.

```jsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in/js';

it('should have small font', () => {
  const SmallText = styled.div({
    fontSize: '12px',
  });

  const { getByText } = render(<SmallText>hello world</SmallText>);

  expect(getByText('hello world')).toHaveCompiledCss('font-size', '12px');
});
```

We can also go a step further and test dynamic props as well.

```jsx
it('should appear red', () => {
  const SmallText = styled.div`
    color: ï¼„{(props) => props.color}px;
  `;

  const { getByText } = render(<SmallText color="red">hello world</SmallText>);

  expect(getByText('hello world')).toHaveCompiledCss('color', 'red');
});
```

> **Note** - It might sound tempting to want a snapshot serializer to make assertions against Compiled.
> We strongly discourage this so we don't supply one.
> We can get something more valuable with visual regression tests,
> else assert the specific styles you're interested in -
> **don't snapshot the world**!
