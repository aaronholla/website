# Writing CSS

## Vendor prefixing

Prefixing CSS declarations enables us to ignore slight browser differences and worry instead for our experiences we're developing.

```css
user-select: none;
```

Becomes:

```css
-webkit-user-select: none;
-moz-user-select: none;
-ms-user-select: none;
user-select: none;
```

Interestingly not much vendor prefixing is needed today.

## Nested selectors

You're able to nest your selectors like in the following example -
but be warned -
use this with caution.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    div {
      color: red;
      font-size: 12px;

      a {
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

## Nesting selector

The `&` character references the parent selector(s).
In the example below our two selectors (textarea and input) both alter the color on the `:hover` pseudo selector.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    textarea,
    input {
      color: #a7a7a7;
      &:hover {
        color: #000;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

Becomes:

```css
textarea,
input {
  color: #a7a7a7;
}
textarea:hover,
input:hover {
  color: #000;
}
```

Note how both `textarea` and `input` both have a hover selector.

## Dangling pseudos

These rules are transformed to recieve a nesting selector.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :before {
      content: 'Hello';
    }
  `}
/>
```

Becomes:

```css
&:before {
  content: 'Hello';
}
```
