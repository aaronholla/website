# Atomic CSS

If you're just getting started with Compiled you don't need to worry too much about how this all works,
but keep reading if you're interested understanding more!

## What is it

It is a pattern of writing CSS to reduce the total amount of defined styles by creating a single rule for every declaration.
Typical CSS would look like:

```css
.button {
  border: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: purple;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

When applied to a button:

```html
<button class="button">Hello world</button>
```

However when products scale to hundreds,
even thousands of developers,
defined styles can get wild,
and very duplicated.

If we take the same rule and change it to be atomic CSS:

```css
.b-none {
  border: none;
}

.fs-14 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bgc-purple {
  background-color: purple;
}

.br-3 {
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

When applied to the same button:

```html
<button class="b-none fs-14 bgc-purple br-3">Hello world</button>
```

When other components end up defining similar styles,
they end up using the same rules.

```html
<span class="fs-14">Text</span>
```

## Why is it useful

The obvious benefit is for re-use of CSS rules and reducing the total amount of defined CSS.
However there are other benefits over and beyond just re-using CSS rules.

### CSS cascade

When every declaration is defined as an atomic rule _and_ you can't create CSS at runtime,
encouraging [composition of styles](/composition) can seem impossible.
If nothing was done depending on the order of rendered components you'd get different results.
Not good.

Luckily there is a solution.
We can encode all the data needed to ensure developers can combine property values,
without the gotchas of [CSS cascade ordering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

Take these two atomic rules:

```css
.color-blue {
  color: blue;
}
.color-red {
  color: red;
}
```

There are two pieces of data that can be used in the class names.

1. The atomic group - in this case `color`
1. The atomic value - in this case `blue` and `red`

Using them we ensure that only one atomic group can exist in an elements class name.
We introduce a small utility to help with that,
a function called `ax`:

```jsx
<div className={ax(['color-blue color-red'])} />
```

Then the final result becomes:

```jsx
<div class="color-red" />
```

The last atomic group defined wins.

### Ordered pseudos

When defining pseudo classes atomic CSS imposes some restrictions.
Remember,
only one CSS rule per declaration can exist!

Take these two examples which order `hover` and `active` pseudo classes differently,
but they share the same atomic rule,
what happens?

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
  `}
/>
```

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :active {
      color: red;
    }
    :hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  `}
/>
```

The simple answer is it depends which component renders first!
Which is inconsistent at best,
and just plain wrong at worse.

To ensure we have a stable experience enforcement of a specific ordering of pseudo classes is done using **LVFHA**:

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **F**ocus
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

The last defined pseudo wins.
For the list above,
active state would take priority over hover state.
This ordering ensures a stable,
consistent experience.

## Pitfalls

There are trade-offs for everything.
Atomic CSS while dramatically reducing the total amount of defined CSS,
increases HTML markup from the addition of added classes to elements.

Every CSS declaration will add another class to the element,
scaling linearly,
you can see this on the first example on this page.
However at scale this can prove to be worth it.

There _are_ ways to improve this,
when we have [completed the CSS extraction story](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58) we have some [optimization ideas to investigate](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/335).
