import { StyledExample, StyledInvalidExample } from '../../examples/styled';

# Styled Components

Both template literals and objects are supported with Compiled,
check out the code that is generated.

<StyledExample />

> **Tip -** Hover over the example rendered component above to see the actual rendered HTML!

## Dynamic props

Dynamic styles are front and center with Compiled.
If you've used Styled Components or Emotion you'll feel right at home -
the only constraint is that they can't return any CSS!
_Simple values are only_.

Any props that are also valid HTML attributes will be passed down to the underlying DOM node -
else they won't be.
The following example shows this behavior - note that `massive` is not applied to the `span`.

<StyledInvalidExample />

## Prop typing

With TypeScript support baked in you'll have a great time using it,
any inline interpolation will have access to the props defined in the tagged template generic.

```
import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';

const BigIfTrue = styled.div<{ big: true }>`
  font-size: ${props => big ? 100 : 10};
`;

<BigIfTrue />
 ^^^^^^^^^ Property 'big' is missing in type [..]
```
