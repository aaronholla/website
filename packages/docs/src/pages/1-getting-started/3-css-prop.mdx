# Css Prop

The `css` prop made famous by Emotion is available in Compiled!
Both strings and objects are supported -
check out the code that is generated below.

<CssPropExample />

## Css strings

A common theme of Compiled is to enable us to quickly and easily convert our previous CSS in JS solution over.
Css strings are supported as well.

<CssPropTemplateLiteralExample />

## Passing through `className` or `style`

When passing either `className` or `style` you'll need to statically define it.
Since Compiled can't statically know where either prop will be if we're spreading it,
we need to be explicit.

### Works

```jsx
<div
  style={{ display: 'block' }}
  className="my class name"
  css={{ fontSize: 12 }}
/>
```

### Doesn't work

```jsx
<div {...props} css={{ fontSize: 12 }} />
```
