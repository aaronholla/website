# Styled Component

The `styled` API that we love from Styled Components is ready for us in Compiled!
Both strings and objects are supported -
check out the code that is generated below.

<StyledExample />

## Dynamic styles

Dynamic styles are front and center with Compiled.
If you've used Styled Components or Emotion you'll feel right at home -
the only constraint is that they can't return any CSS!
_Simple values only_.

Any props that are also valid HTML attributes will be passed down to the underlying DOM node -
else they will be ignored.
The following example shows this behavior - note that the `massive` prop is not on the `span` (click the HTML button)!

<StyledInvalidExample />

> **Remember** - Everything is compiled.
> We don't pay the cost of needing a lookup table to remove these properties at runtime! ðŸ˜Ž

### Transient props

Sometimes we want to use a prop name but we don't want it to appear on the DOM element as an attribute.
Luckily you can,
simply prefix the prop with `$` and even if it's a valid HTML attribute it won't be applied.

In the following example see that `color` is applied to the DOM element,
but `$color` is not.

<StyledTransientProps />

## `As` prop

Created a styled component but want it to have different markup?
This prop has you covered.

```tsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';

const H100 = styled.h1({
  fontSize: 12,
});

<H100 as="span" />;
```

Here we render a `h1` element as a `span`.

## Composing components

Sometimes you'll want to add styles to a component that already exists.
If we invoke the styled function we can do just that!

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const StyledLink = styled(Link)`
  color: blue;
`;
```

## Prop typing

With type support baked in you'll have a great time using it with TypeScript,
any inline interpolation will have access to the props defined in the tagged template generic.
Typing from composed components is also inherited.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';

const BigIfTrue = styled.div<{ big: true }>`
  font-size: ${props => big ? 100 : 10};
`;

<BigIfTrue />
 ^^^^^^^^^ Property 'big' is missing in type [..]
```
