# Css Compiler

Compiled uses [Stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js) to compile CSS.
Because of this the majority of CSS you write can be converted from your previous CSS in JS solutions into Compiled and they'll work great!

Stylus enables some powerful things like...

## Nested selectors

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    a {
      color: red;
      font-size: 12px;
    }
  `}
/>
```

## Parent reference

The `&` character references the parent selector(s).
In the example below our two selectors (textarea and input) both alter the color on the :hover pseudo selector.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    textarea,
    input {
      color: #a7a7a7;
      &:hover {
        color: #000;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

Compiles to (note how both `textarea` and `input` both have a hover selector!):

```css
textarea,
input {
  color: #a7a7a7;
}
textarea:hover,
input:hover {
  color: #000;
}
```
