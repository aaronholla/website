# Server Side Rendering

Server side rendering in Compiled works by compiling the CSS next to the element itself.
This is very similar to how Emotion accomplishes it by default.

This strategy has a few benefits -
the biggest being when rendering React on the server with the [streaming API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertonodestream) your component styles are streamed together with your component markup,
resulting in things being rendered to users faster.

```jsx
import { renderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/server';
import { App } from '@app/code';

renderToNodeStream(<App />);
```

> **Warning** - This approach can interfere with nth child and similar selectors as it is inserts style tags directly into your markup.
> We have an [RFC where we are thinking about what to do with this](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled-css-in-js/issues/31) - please join the conversation!
