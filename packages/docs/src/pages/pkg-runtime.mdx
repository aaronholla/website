# @compiled/runtime

Exports functionality used at runtime.
Generally you would not install this directly as it is installed with the core library.

```bash
npm install @compiled/runtime --save
```

## CC

Ensures only the minimum amount of styles are rendered on the server -
on the client it doesn't do anything and just [renders a fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html).

For more information have a read of [Server Side Rendering](/server-side-rendering#how-it-works) how it works.

```jsx
import { CC } from '@compiled/runtime';

<CC></CC>;
```

## CS

Moves child CSS to the head of the document on the client,
and renders an inline `style` element on the server.

```jsx
import { CS } from '@compiled/runtime';

<CS>{['.foo{color:#ff5630;}']}</CS>;
```

## ax

Similar in functionality to the `cx` function from the `classnames` package,
however it is optimized for atomic CSS grouping.
Will concat class names and ensure uniqueness of atomic groups.

```tsx
import { ax } from '@compiled/runtime';

ax(['_k48pni7l', '_syaz18rw', '_syazff21']); // "_k48pni7l _syazff21"
```
