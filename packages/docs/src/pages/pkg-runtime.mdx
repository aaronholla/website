# @compiled/runtime

```bash
npm i @compiled/runtime
```

> **Note** - This is an internal library that you probably shouldn't use directly.

## CC

The _component component_ component.
Its primary use is for ensuring only the minimum amount of styles is rendered on the server -
on the client it doesn't do anything and just [renders a fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html).

For more information have a read of [Server Side Rendering](/server-side-rendering#how-it-works) how it works.

```jsx
<CC></CC>
```

## CS

The _compiled style_ component.
It moves child compiled CSS to the head of the document.
There usually isn't a need to use this directly.
Each CSS block should be an element in the children array.

```jsx
import { CS } from '@compiled/style';

<CS hash="css-zd46j1">{['.css-zd46j1{color:#ff5630;}']}</CS>;
```
