# Styled

Useful when wanting to create components that have associated styles which come with behaviour such as `ref` and `as` prop support.
[CSS prop](/css-prop) can be used when wanting more control over your component.

<StyledString />

## Dynamic declarations

Powered behind the scenes by CSS variables.
Any props that are valid HTML attributes will be passed down to the underlying DOM node -
otherwise they will be ignored.

This example shows that behavior -
if you view inspect the example element in dev tools you'll see the `primary` prop has not been passed through.

<StyledDynamic />

> **Remember** - It's all done at build time.
> No cost is paid at runtime to check if the prop is a valid HTML attribute.

### Transient props

If you want to use a prop name that is also a valid HTML attribute but don't want it to appear on the element,
prefix the prop with `$` and it won't be applied.

This example shows that `color` is on the element,
but `$color` is not.

<StyledTransientProps />

## The as prop

Changing the markup to something else such as a `h1` to a `span` can be useful.
The `as` prop can be used to change it at runtime.

This example shows a `h1` element being set to a `span`.

<StyledAsProp />

## Composing components

Wrap an already defined component to pass extra styles to it (under the hood it does this via the `className` prop).
The composing components styles will take precedence over the composed components styles,
assuming they're both styled with Compiled.

<StyledComposition />

## Types

Type support is baked so you'll have a great time using Compiled with TypeScript,
any interpolation will have access to the props defined in the tagged template generic.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/core';

const BigIfTrue = styled.div<{ big: true }>`
  font-size: ${props => big ? 100 : 10};
`;

<BigIfTrue />
 ^^^^^^^^^ Property 'big' is missing in type [..]
```

> **Note** - Typing of composed components is also inherited.
