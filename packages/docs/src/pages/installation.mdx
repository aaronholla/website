# Installation

Setup is required.
Install the [React](https://reactjs.org) package with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @compiled/react
```

Compiled uses Babel to transform your code,
you'll need to use either [its CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
or your bundler of choice that supports Babel.

## Babel setup

Wire up the plugin in your [Babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration).
It's best if the plugin is defined first in the plugins array.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/react/babel-plugin"]
}
```

Now you're ready to style your first component!
If you're looking for advanced configuration [look at the package documentation](/pkg-babel-plugin).
