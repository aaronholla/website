# Migrating to Compiled

Follow [installation](/installation) instructions before continuing.

## Styled Components

Replace the imports with `@compiled/core`.

```diff
-import styled from 'styled-components';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
`;

styled.div({
  fontSize: 12px,
  color: props => props.color,
});
```

There exists a [codemod](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) to streamline this.

```bash
npx jscodeshift --transform node_modules/@compiled/core/dist/codemods/styled-components-to-compiled <path>
```

Where `<path>` is the path to your source code.
If you're using TypeScript make sure to add `--parser=tsx --extensions=tsx` to your `jscodeshift` command.

## Emotion

Replace the imports with `@compiled/core`.

```diff
-/** @jsx jsx */
-import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
+import '@compiled/react';

(props) => (
  <div
    css={{
      color: 'red',
      backgroundColor: props.background,
    }}
  />
)

(props) => (
  <div
-   css={css`
+   css={`
      color: red;
      background-color: ${props.background}
    `}
  />
)
```

```diff
-import styled from '@emotion/styled';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/react';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
`;

styled.div({
  fontSize: 12px,
  color: props => props.color,
});
```

There exists a [codemod](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) to streamline this.

```bash
npx jscodeshift --transform node_modules/@compiled/core/dist/codemods/emotion-to-compiled <path>
```

Where `<path>` is the path to your source code.
If you're using TypeScript make sure to add `--parser=tsx --extensions=tsx` to your `jscodeshift` command.

## Current limitations

The following are defined areas that are planned to be implemented in the future.
When migrating over you may find code paths that aren't working as expected -
in that case please [raise an issue](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=Bug:&labels=bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B) and we'll look into it.

### Conditional rules

Conditionally declared CSS rules are not able to be defined at this time but will be [supported in the future](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/278).

```jsx
<div
  css={{
    color: 'blue',
    ...(props.isPrimary && { fontSize: 15, fontWeight: bold }),
  }}
/>
```

### Missing APIs

There is work planned to flesh out the remainder APIs.

- [Global component](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/62)
- [ClassNames component](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/342)
- [Animation keyframes](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/14)
- [Theming](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/18)
