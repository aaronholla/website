# Migrating

Migrating to Compiled isn't that hard depending how dynamic your CSS is.
It's more of a mind shift than anything.
The single precondition for this page is completing the [installation instructions](/1-getting-started/1-installation),
so if you haven't already go read that.

## From Styled Components

Just replace the imports and we're done!
If we have dynamic CSS values they'll still work fantastically except we don't need to re-calculate the CSS at runtime to make it work.

```diff
-import styled from 'styled-components';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';

styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  color: ${props => props.color};
`;
```

```diff
-import styled from 'styled-components';
+import { styled } from '@compiled/css-in-js';

styled.div({
  fontSize: 12px,
  color: props => props.color,
});
```

## From Emotion

Just replace the imports,
if you're using `@emotion/styled` the migration is the same from above.

```diff
-/** @jsx jsx */
-import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
+import '@compiled/css-in-js';

(props) => (
  <div
    css={{
      color: 'red',
      backgroundColor: props.background,
    }}
  />
)
```

```diff
-/** @jsx jsx */
-import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
+import '@compiled/css-in-js';

(props) => (
  <div
-    css={css`
+    css={`
      color: red;
      background-color: ${props.background}
    `}
  />
)
```

## Generating CSS at runtime

In a large majority of libraries today you'll see something like this,
where it returns new CSS based on some props:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const getBackgroundGradient = (color, percent) => ({
  background: `linear-gradient(${color}, ${color}) 0 / ${percent}% 100% no-repeat
      ${color}`,
});

styled.input`
  ＄{(props) => getBackgroundGradient(props.color, props.percent)}
`;
```

Every time `color` or `percent` changes it will recalculate the CSS and then re-render.
While at a glance this looks okay it's actually quite **dangerous and unperformant**,
a massive footgun every developer is wielding!
Especially if `percent` isn't just whole numbers!

In Compiled it's **impossible to generate CSS at runtime**,
so the above code can't migrate across.
How might we do it then?

Well the direction we can go in is by statically defining the CSS properties,
and then assigning function interpolations (the arrow functions inside the styled declaration) to set the values at runtime.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const getBackgroundGradient = (color, percent) => ({
  `linear-gradient(${color}, ${color}) 0 / ${percent}% 100% no-repeat
      ${color}`,
});

styled.input`
  background: ＄{props => getBackgroundGradient(props.color, props.percent)};
`;
```

This accomplishes two things for us:

1. We've **successfully migrated** our runtime CSS over!
   It turns out it didn't need to be generated at runtime anyway.
1. We've **fixed our performance problem**!
   Now it doesn't matter how many ticks `percent` has,
   it'll be buttery smooth.
   All because of the constraint of _no runtime CSS_ this footgun has been disarmed.
