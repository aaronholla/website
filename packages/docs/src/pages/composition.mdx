# Composition

Composing styles together enables style reuse and flexibility.
Traditionally when defining CSS it is not the `class` order that ensures style get applied,
but the the [order of CSS rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance) in the DOM.
This is a common cause for developer confusion.

Compiled eliminates these cascade gotchas by ensuring the last CSS property defined always wins.

<CompositionIdentifier />

When composing styles together it's important to remember that the last defined style will win.
In this example we can see that red overrides the pink color.

<CompositionMultiple />

> **Note** - When composing styles together it is recommended to use array composition over [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax),
> like the example above.

Composition works with all APIs found in Compiled.
Read [more about atomic CSS](/atomic-css#overriding-through-composition) to understanding how this works under the hood.
