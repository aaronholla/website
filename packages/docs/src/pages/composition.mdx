# Composition

Compiled allows you to statically compose your styles together.
There are a few benefits of composing in this fashion,
outside of reusability and performance the biggest is that styles get applied in a consistent way.
The last property defined wins -
which when used is immediately obvious to the developer.

When composing depending on the order it will end differently,
but hopefully you can see when reading the code what will happen.
Try and guess before looking at the rendered component below!

<CompositionOrder />

Composition wouldn't be complete if you couldn't also compose from module imports.
It mostly works but there _are_ some cavets right now,
most importantly:

- `babel` and `tsc` with typechecking turned off breaks this
- traversing node modules doesn't work

This is something that can and will be fixed.
