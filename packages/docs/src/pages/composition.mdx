# Composition

Composing styles together enables powerful patterns.
Traditionally when defining CSS it is not the `class` order that ensures style get applie,
but the the order of CSS rules.
This is a common cause for developer confusion.

Compiled eliminates cascade gotchas.
Regardless of composing from a parent or child component,
the last CSS property defined wins.

<CompositionImports />

When composing styles together it's important to remember that the last defined style will win.
In this example we can see that in action.

<CompositionOrder />
