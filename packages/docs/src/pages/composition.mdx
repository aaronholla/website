# Composition

Composing styles together enables powerful patterns.
Traditionally when defining CSS it is not the `class` order that ensures style get applied,
but the the [order of CSS rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).
This is a common cause for developer confusion.

Compiled eliminates cascade gotchas by ensuring the last CSS property defined always wins.

<CompositionIdentifier />

When composing styles together it's important to remember that the last defined style will win.
In this example it can be seen in action.

<CompositionMultiple />

Composition works with all APIs found in Compiled.
Read [more about atomic CSS](/atomic-css#css-cascade) to understanding how this works under the hood.
