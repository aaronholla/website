# Composition

Compiled allows us to statically compose your styles together.
There are a few benefits of composing in this fashion,
outside of reusability and performance the biggest is that styles get applied in a consistent way.
The last property defined wins -
which when used is immediately obvious to the developer.

When composing it's important to remember that the last defined style will win.
In the next example we can see that in action.

<CompositionOrder />

## Composing from modules

Composition wouldn't be complete if we couldn't also compose from module imports.
It mostly works but there _are_ some cavets right now,
most importantly:

- `babel` and `tsc` with typechecking turned off breaks this
- traversing node modules doesn't work

This is something that can and will be fixed.
