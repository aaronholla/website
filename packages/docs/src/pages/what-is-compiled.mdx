# What is Compiled?

Compiled is a build time CSS in JS library.
For us at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) CSS in JS has provided a fantastic developer experience,
deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism made it super easy for consumers to use our components.
Just import and go!

However we've seen scaling problems,
multiple usages of runtime CSS in JS libraries,
and unintended performance gotchas -
death by a thousand cuts.

We want more from our styling library.

## How it works

Compiled transforms your components you've styled.
Everything the component needs is baked into the resulting JavaScript bundle.

It takes your initial code in all its glory:

<BeforeHowItWorks />

And then bakes everything in:

<AfterHowItWorks />

Which enables you to ship components to any consumer,
without them needing to configure their tooling.
Just import and go.
This is powerful,
and more importantly the same as how runtime CSS in JS libraries work!
