# What is Compiled?

Compiled is a _build time_ CSS in JS library.
For us at Atlassian CSS in JS solutions have provided a fantastic developer experience,
deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism of the libraries we've used make it super easy for consumers to consume our components.
Just import and use them -
and you're good to go!

But at the same time we've seen scaling problems.
Unintended performance gotchas.
Death by a thousand cuts.

## How it works

Compiled compiles your CSS in JS at build time by statically analyzing your code and then transforming it into Compiled Components.
Everything we need to use the component is included along side it in the JavaScript bundle.

We take your initial code in all its glory:

<BeforeHowItWorks />

And then transform it into a Compiled Component:

<AfterHowItWorks />

Which then at runtime will move the styles to the head of the document.

This kind of transformation allows us to deliver your component to any consumer,
without needing them to configure/setup their tooling.
Just import and go.
This is powerful,
and more importantly exactly the same as current CSS in JS libraries work -
with one catch.

_CSS can't be generated at runtime._

This single constraint opens a lot of doors for us.
Performance gotchas no longer possible.
Build time optimizations.
Runtime guarantees.

While Compiled currently only targets inline Compiled Components,
we'll eventually get to more exciting grounds -
optional CSS extraction for bundlers.
It'll be super exciting to make work,
come [chime into the RFC](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled-css-in-js/issues/36) if you're interested.
