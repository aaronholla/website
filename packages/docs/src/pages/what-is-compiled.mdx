# What is Compiled?

Compiled is a build time [atomic CSS](/atomic-css) in JS library.
For us at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) CSS in JS has provided a fantastic developer experience,
with deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism made it super easy for consumers to use our components.
Just import and go!

However we've seen scaling problems,
unintended performance gotchas -
death by a thousand cuts.
Where the focus has been swayed towards the developer and away from the user.

We want more from our styling library.
We want more for our users.
We want to do everything that is possible at build time.

## How it works

Compiled transforms components you've styled.
Everything the component needs is baked into the resulting JavaScript bundle.

It takes your initial code in all its glory:

<BeforeHowItWorks />

And then bakes everything in:

<AfterHowItWorks />

Which enables you to ship components to any consumer,
without them needing to configure their tooling.
Just import and go.
This is powerful,
and more importantly the same experience for developers consuming components using runtime CSS in JS libraries today.
