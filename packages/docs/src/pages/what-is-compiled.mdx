# What is Compiled?

Compiled is a build time [atomic CSS](/atomic-css)-in-JS library.

For us at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) CSS-in-JS has provides a fantastic developer experience,
with deep integrations with JavaScript by design,
and the delivery mechanism making it super easy for consumers to use our components.
Just import and go!

However we've seen scaling problems,
unintended performance gotchas -
death by a thousand cuts.
Where the focus has been swayed towards the developer and away from the user.

We want more from our styling library and our users.
We want to do everything we can at build time.

## How it works

Compiled transforms components you've styled.
Everything the component needs to function is baked into the resulting JavaScript bundle.

<BeforeHowItWorks />

Becomes:

<AfterHowItWorks />

This enables you to ship your components to any consumer without needing them to configure their tooling.
Just import and go.

This is powerful,
and importantly the same experience for developers who consume components styled with runtime CSS-in-JS libraries today.
