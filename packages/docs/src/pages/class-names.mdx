# ClassNames

Use `ClassNames` to have more control over a componen where styles are not necessarily tied to an element,
enabling powerful patterns with [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

<ClassNamesObj />

## Dynamic declarations

Dynamic declarations are powered by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties),
make sure to set the `style` prop.

<ClassNamesDynamic />

## Composing styles

Composing styles through props allows your consumers to add and override styles.
Make sure to pass through `className` and `style`.

<ClassNamesComposition />
