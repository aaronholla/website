# ClassNames

Use `ClassNames` when wanting a component which has styles not necessarily tied to an element,
enabling powerful patterns such as [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

```
example here
```

## Dynamic declarations

Dynamic declarations are powered by [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties),
make sure to set the `style` prop.

```
example here
```

## Composing styles

Composing styles through props allows your consumers to add and override styles.
Make sure to pass through `className` and `style`.

```
example here
```
