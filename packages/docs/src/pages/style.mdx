# @compiled/style

```bash
npm i @compiled/style
```

## default

Moves child compiled CSS to the head of the document.
There usually isn't a need to use this directly.
Each CSS block should be an element in the children array.

```jsx
import Style from '@compiled/style';

<Style hash="css-zd46j1">{['.css-zd46j1{color:#ff5630;}']}</Style>;
```
