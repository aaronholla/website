# CSS Prop

Useful when wanting more control over your component.
[Styled](/styled) can be used when wanting to create components that have associated styles which come with behaviour such as `ref` and `as` prop support.

<CssPropObj />

<CssPropString />

## Dynamic rules

Powered behind the scenes by CSS variables.

<CssPropDynamic />

## Composition gotchas

When composing styles from a parent component passed down as a `className` make sure to also define a `style` prop so dynamic rules work.

### Correct props

The `className` and `style` props are explicitly defined so dynamic rules work.

<CssPropCompositionCorrect />

### Spread pops

The overflow `props` are spread onto the element so the composed styles are not applied.

<CssPropCompositionIncorrect />

### Missing style

The `style` prop is missing so dynamic rules don't work.
The color declaration has been set but the CSS variable has not,
so it falls back to `--_kmurgp has not been set` and then looks for the closest parent `color`.
In this case it receives the `body` color value.

<CssPropCompositionNoStyle />
