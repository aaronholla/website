# CSS Prop

Useful when wanting more control over your component.
[Styled](/styled) can be used when wanting to create components that have associated styles which come with behaviour such as `ref` and `as` prop support.

CSS prop is enabled when any import of the `@compiled/core` module is found,
so for example when using the `styled` API via `import { styled } from '@compiled/core'`
CSS prop will be enabled as well.

<CssPropString />

## Dynamic declarations

Powered behind the scenes by CSS variables.

<CssPropDynamic />

## Composition gotchas

To ensure only the minimal amount of code is generated Compiled will only enable setting style from a parent component when you've explicitly defined `className` and `style` props.

When composing styles from a parent component passing down `className` make sure to also define a `style` prop so dynamic declarations work.
They are powered by CSS variables present in the `style` prop.

Here the `className` and `style` props are explicitly defined so styling works correctly.

<CssPropCompositionCorrect />

The next few example show what happens if you don't do this.

### Spread pops

The overflow `props` are spread onto the element so the composed styles are not applied.

<CssPropCompositionIncorrect />

### Missing style

The `style` prop is missing so the CSS variables used to power dynamic declarations aren't set.
In this case instead it receives the `body` color value.

<CssPropCompositionNoStyle />
