# CSS Prop

The `css` prop made famous by Emotion is available in Compiled!
Both strings and objects are supported -
check out the code that is generated below.

<CssPropExample />

Using `css` prop is easy but powerful,
it's useful when we want to choose your own destiny and other APIs,
like `styled`,
are missing that one thing we need.

## Pass through class and style

When passing either `className` or `style` you'll need to statically define it.
Since Compiled can't statically know where either prop will be if we're spreading it,
we need to be explicit.

### Works

Class name and style are both picked up as expected because we can statically analyze their usage.

```jsx
<div
  style={{ display: 'block' }}
  className="my class name"
  css={{ fontSize: 12 }}
/>
```

### Doesn't work

Since we can't statically analyze either ones usage it doesn't work.

```jsx
<div {...props} css={{ fontSize: 12 }} />
```
