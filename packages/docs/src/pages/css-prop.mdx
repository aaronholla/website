# CSS Prop

Useful when wanting more control over your component.
[Styled](/styled) can be used when wanting to create components that have associated styles which come with behaviour such as `ref` and `as` prop support.

## Composition gotchas

When composing styles from a parent component passed down as a `className` make sure to also define a `style` prop so dynamic rules work.

### Correct props

The `className` and `style` props are explicitly defined so dynamic rules work.

```

### Spread pops

The overflow `props` are spread onto the element so the composed styles are not applied.

```

### Missing style

The `style` prop is missing so dynamic rules don't work.

```jsx
live example here
```
