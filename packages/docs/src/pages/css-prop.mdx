# CSS Prop

Useful when wanting more control over your component.

CSS prop is enabled when any usage of the `@compiled/react` module is found,
for example when using the `styled` API the CSS prop will be enabled as well.

<CssPropString />

## Dynamic declarations

Powered behind the scenes by CSS variables.

<CssPropDynamic />

## Composition gotchas

To ensure the smallest amount of code is generated Compiled will only enable setting styles through props when the element has explicitly defined `className` and `style` props.

When composing styles from props with `className` make sure to also define a `style` prop so dynamic declarations work.
They are powered by CSS variables present in the `style` prop.

Here the `className` and `style` props are explicitly defined so styling works correctly.

<CssPropCompositionCorrect />

The next few example show what happens if you don't do this.

### Spread pops

The overflow `props` are spread onto the element so the composed styles are not applied.

<CssPropCompositionIncorrect />

### Missing style

The `style` prop is missing so the CSS variables used to power dynamic declarations aren't set.
In this case instead it receives the `body` color value instead of pink.

<CssPropCompositionNoStyle />
