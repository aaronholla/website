# Css Compiler

Compiled uses [Stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js) to compile CSS.
Because of this the majority of CSS we write can be converted from your previous CSS in JS solutions into Compiled and they'll work great!
Stylis enables some powerful features such as the following.

## Vendor prefixing

This is done automatically for you.
Simply write your CSS as you would:

```css
display: flex;
```

And it gets turned into:

```css
display: -webkit-box;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: flex;
```

## Nested selectors

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    a {
      color: red;
      font-size: 12px;
    }
  `}
/>
```

## Parent reference

The `&` character references the parent selector(s).
In the example below our two selectors (textarea and input) both alter the color on the :hover pseudo selector.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    textarea,
    input {
      color: #a7a7a7;
      &:hover {
        color: #000;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

Compiles to (note how both `textarea` and `input` both have a hover selector!):

```css
textarea,
input {
  color: #a7a7a7;
}
textarea:hover,
input:hover {
  color: #000;
}
```
