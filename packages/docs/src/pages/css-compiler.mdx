# Css Compiler

Compiled uses [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to compile our CSS.
This makes a wide ecosystem of plugins available for use,
as well as nice optimizations like minification while not paying any runtime cost which you can't get with other CSS in JS solutions.

## Vendor prefixing

This is done automatically for you.
Simply write our CSS as we would usually:

```css
user-select: none;
```

And it gets turned into:

```css
-webkit-user-select: none;
-moz-user-select: none;
-ms-user-select: none;
user-select: none;
```

Interestingly because the oldest browser we target is IE11 you don't need much vendor prefixing done.

## Nested selectors

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    div {
      color: red;
      font-size: 12px;

      a {
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

## Dangling pseudos

When there are dangling pseudos found in your CSS they will automatically be transformed to take the parents selector.
For example:

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    :before {
      content: 'Hello';
    }
  `}
/>
```

Actually becomes:

```css
&:before {
  content: 'Hello';
}
```

Which then is used to reference the _parent_ selector as described next.

## Parent reference

The `&` character references the parent selector(s).
In the example below our two selectors (textarea and input) both alter the color on the `:hover` pseudo selector.

```jsx
<div
  css={`
    textarea,
    input {
      color: #a7a7a7;
      &:hover {
        color: #000;
      }
    }
  `}
/>
```

Compiles to:

```css
textarea,
input {
  color: #a7a7a7;
}
textarea:hover,
input:hover {
  color: #000;
}
```

Note how both `textarea` and `input` both have a hover selector!
