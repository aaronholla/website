## Bake

Write your styles in JavaScript leveraging the language to create expressive,
dynamic experiences.

```jsx
import '@compiled/core';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'hotpink',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
or any other tool that supports Babel.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

```jsx
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/core';

const _2 = '._syaz1q9v{color: hotpink}';
const _ = '._1wybfyhu{font-size: 48px;}';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <CC>
    <CS>{[_, _2]}</CS>
    <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
  </CC>
);
```

A component that can be used by anyone without needing to configure a bundler has now been built,
everything is _baked in_ and ready to go.

## Consume

Import and go!
It could be a component published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) or defined in your app,
no matter where or how its used because everything is baked in no bundler configuration is needed,
[server side rendering](./docs/server-side-rendering) included.

```jsx
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '@text/components';

<LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>;
```

## Extract

Turn on the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) plugin and all components styled with Compiled in your app,
sourced from [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
and everywhere else,
will have their styles extracted to a single [atomic style sheet](./docs/atomic-css).

1. Build your app

```bash
$ npm i @compiled/parcel-plugin
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

2. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

3. All style rules,
   `<CC>`, and
   `<CS>` components are removed from your JavaScript bundle

```jsx
export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span className="_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu">{children}</span>
);
```

> It's recommended to only extract in apps.
> Shipping a component library or design system?
> Keep styles baked in and then get your consumers to extract.

We're empowering the JavaScript community to extract all styles!
No longer just focusing on a single app,
but the entire ecosystem.
Extracting to an atomic style sheet will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
