## Bake

Write your styles in JavaScript leveraging the language to create expressive,
dynamic experiences.

```jsx
import '@compiled/core';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'hotpink',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
or any other tool that supports Babel.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

```jsx
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/core';

const _2 = '._syaz1q9v{color: hotpink}';
const _ = '._1wybfyhu{font-size: 48px;}';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) =>
  React.createElement(
    CC,
    null,
    React.createElement(CS, null, [_, _2]),
    React.createElement('span', { className: '_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu' }, children)
  );
```

A component that can be used by anyone without needing to configure a bundler has now been built,
everything is _baked in_ and ready to go.

## Consume

Import and go!
It could be a component published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) or defined in your app,
no matter where or how its used because everything is baked in no bundler configuration is needed,
[server side rendering](./docs/server-side-rendering) included.

```jsx
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '@text/components';

<LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>;
```

## Extract

Turn on a bundler plugin and when bundling your app it will find all components styled with Compiled,
from [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
in your app,
everywhere,
and extract all found styles to a single,
[atomic style sheet](./docs/atomic-css).

```bash
$ npm i @compiled/parcel-plugin
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

1. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

2. All style rules,
   `<CC>`, and
   `<CS>` components are removed from your JavaScript bundle

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) =>
  React.createElement(
    'span',
    {
      className: '_1wybfyhu _syaz1q9v',
    },
    children
  );
```

> It's recommended to only extract in apps.
> Shipping a component library or design system?
> Keep styles baked in and then get your consumers to extract.

Let's empower the JavaScript community to extract all styles!
No longer just focusing on our single app,
but the entire ecosystem.
Extracting to an atomic style sheet will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
