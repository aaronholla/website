## Bake

Don't change a thing.
Style the same way you currently do,
except now it's way faster at runtime with no footguns.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@compiled/core';

export const Button = styled.button`
  font-weight: 500;
  color: ${(props) => props.color};
`;
```

Configure [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
or any bundler that supports Babel.
You now have a component that can be used _anywhere_,
without needing any bundler configuration.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

## Consume

Import and go!
It could be published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
in your application,
or even in a rogue Github repo.
Wherever it is -
you can use it without needing to configure your bundler.
[Server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) included!

```jsx
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';

const Issue = () => {
  return <Button>Create</Button>;
};
```

## Extract

Turn on the bundler plugin,
and when bundling your app it will find every component styled with Compiled,
from [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
in your application,
or anywhere else,
and extract all of their styles to a single,
[atomic style sheet](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/#longhand-shorthand).

```bash
$ npm i @compiled/parcel-plugin
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

Atomic style sheet generated.

```css
._k48pni7l {
  font-weight: 600;
}
._1p1dangw {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
._syaz1aj3 {
  color: var(--_1ylxx6h);
}
```

Style declarations,
`<CC>`, and
`<CS>` are all removed from your source code.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export const EmphasisText = (props) => {
  const color = props.massive ? '#00B8D9' : '#36B37E';

  return React.createElement(
    'span',
    {
      className: ax(['_syaz1aj3', '_1p1dangw', '_k48pni7l']),
      style: { '--_1ylxx6h': color },
    },
    props.children
  );
};
```
