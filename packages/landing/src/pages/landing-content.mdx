## Bake

Write your styles in JavaScript,
next to where they're needed most.

```jsx
import '@compiled/core';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'red',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
or any other bundler that supports Babel.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

You now have a component that can be used by anyone without needing to configure their bundler,
everything is _baked in_.

## Consume

Import and go!
It could be published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
defined in your application,
or even in a rogue Github repo.
Wherever it is -
anyone can use it without needing to configure their bundler.
[Server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) included!

```jsx
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '@text/components';

<LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>;
```

## Extract

Turn on a bundler plugin,
and when bundling your app it will find every component styled with Compiled,
from [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
in your application,
or anywhere else,
and extract all of their styles to a single,
[atomic style sheet](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/#longhand-shorthand).

```bash
$ npm i @compiled/parcel-plugin
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

1. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

2. All style declarations,
   `<CC>`, and
   `<CS>` components are removed from your source code

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) =>
  React.createElement(
    'span',
    {
      className: '_1wybfyhu _syaz1q9v',
    },
    children
  );
```

Extract to atomic CSS will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
