## Bake

Write your styles in JavaScript next to where they're needed most.

```jsx
import '@compiled/core';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) => (
  <span
    css={{
      color: 'hotpink',
      fontSize: 48,
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

[Configure Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files) and build your components using its [CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli),
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
or any other tool that supports Babel.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@compiled/core/babel-plugin"]
}
```

```bash
$ babel src
Successfully compiled 1 file with Babel (9ms)
```

```jsx
import { CC, CS } from '@compiled/core';

const _2 = '._syaz1q9v{color: hotpink}';
const _ = '._1wybfyhu{font-size: 48px;}';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) =>
  React.createElement(
    CC,
    null,
    React.createElement(CS, null, [_, _2]),
    React.createElement('span', { className: '_syaz1q9v _1wybfyhu' }, children)
  );
```

You now have a component that can be used by anyone without needing to configure their bundler,
everything is _baked in_.

## Consume

Import and go!
It could be published to [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) or defined in your application.
No matter how its used because everything is baked no bundler configuration is needed,
[server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) included.

```jsx
import { LargeHotPinkText } from '@text/components';

<LargeHotPinkText>Hello world</LargeHotPinkText>;
```

## Extract

Turn on a bundler plugin and when bundling your app it will find every component styled with Compiled,
from [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
in your app,
or elsewhere,
and extract all of found styles to a single,
[atomic style sheet](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/#longhand-shorthand).

```bash
$ npm i @compiled/parcel-plugin
$ parcel build
âœ¨  Built in 0.83s.
```

1. An atomic style sheet is generated

```css
._1wybfyhu {
  font-size: 48px;
}
._syaz1q9v {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

2. All style rules,
   `<CC>`, and
   `<CS>` components are removed from your JavaScript bundle.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export const LargeHotPinkText = ({ children }) =>
  React.createElement(
    'span',
    {
      className: '_1wybfyhu _syaz1q9v',
    },
    children
  );
```

> It's recommended to only extract to CSS in applications.
> Shipping a component library or design system?
> Keep it baked in and then get your consumers to extract!

Let's empower the JavaScript community to extract all styles!
No longer just focusing on our single app,
but the entire ecosystem.
Extracting to an atomic style sheet will be [shipping in 2021](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled/issues/58).
